# AppleSeeds Bootcamp - mid-project 

# About the project
# In this project I had to think and build an idea from scratch.
# I took what I learned from the previous session about writing a good CV
# and I decided to make a website for it to save more time.
# i tried to make it easier and faster for those who want to apply for tech jobs.
