# AppleSeeds Bootcamp - mid-project 

**About the project** <br />
In this project I had to think and build an idea from scratch.  <br />
I took what I learned from the previous session about writing a good CV  <br />
and I decided to make a website for it to save more time.  <br />
i tried to make it easier and faster for those who want to apply for tech jobs.  <br />


**Things to improve if i have more time <br />
(I worked on this project for 2 days only)** <br />
1_ add more features to the inputs to make it easier <br />
(e.g. in education to take years input and description about the selected subject) <br />
2_ add preview page <br />
3_ add the ability to redesign the page <br />
4_ send pdf to email <br />
5_ better design <br />
6_ add testing <br />
