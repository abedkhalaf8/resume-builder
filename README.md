# AppleSeeds Bootcamp - mid-project 

# About the project
In this project I had to think and build an idea from scratch. \n
I took what I learned from the previous session about writing a good CV \n
and I decided to make a website for it to save more time. \n
i tried to make it easier and faster for those who want to apply for tech jobs. \n
